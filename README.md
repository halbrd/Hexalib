# Hexalib
Arduino library for controlling my homebrewed hexapod

## Project
This hexapod was created as a research project in my second year of uni at Monash. It has a 3D printed chassis, an Arduino Mega 2560 as the controller board, and is powered by an onboard LiPo battery.

For more about the hexapod, you can visit my **[blog/research log](http://0xapod.blogspot.com.au/)** for the project.
